# Square Eyes

Connecting film lovers.

## Description

This is my first-year course assignment in HTML/CSS at Norrof Front-End Development.
The project is based on the prototype I made in Figma for my CA in Design 1.
The goal is to make a functional, responsive website.

I decided to make som changes from the prototype, to improve user experience. For the desktop version, I centered more content to make it easier on the eyes, and I removed the hamburger menu and changed it to a block navigation.

I did my best to get as far as I could only using HTML/CSS for the hamburger menu, as well as the sliders,
to stay true to the prototype. This was also recommended by my teachers for learning experience.

## The website

I deployed my website from Netlify with the following link:
